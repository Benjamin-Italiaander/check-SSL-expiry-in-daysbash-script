# check the expiry days of a ssl certificate bash script

The [first](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Benjamin-Italiaander/check-SSL-expiry-in-daysbash-script/refs/heads/main/check_ssl.sh) script is a base for running a ssl check just once. This script gives the amount of days before a ssl-certificate will expire.  Just run it like

```bash
./check_ssl.sh domain.tld
```

A more scriptable way to be able to bulk check on ssl-certificates can be found [here](https://github.com/Benjamin-Italiaander/check-SSL-expiry-in-daysbash-script/tree/main/advanced)
